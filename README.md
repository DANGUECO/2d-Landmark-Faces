# 2d-Landmark-Faces

The `landmark_faces.txt` file has the locations in 2D of 68 landmark positions on 9780 faces
This assignment provided by the victoria university of wellington told us to use PCA to transform these points, and feed the input into a classifier to predict the gender of each face. 

This involved classifying into 2 discrete categories. Male or Female.
The clasification algorithm used was Logsitic Regression.
