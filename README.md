# 2d-Landmark-Faces

The `landmark_faces.txt` file has the locations in 2D of 68 landmark positions on 9780 faces
This assignment provided by the victoria university of wellington gave us a task to use PCA to transform these points, and feed the input into a classifier to predict the gender of each face. 

This involved classifying into 2 discrete categories. 0 - Male or 1 - Female.
The clasification algorithm used was Logsitic Regression.
